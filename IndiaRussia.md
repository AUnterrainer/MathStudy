## India and Russia

India and Russia both built reputations in the 20th Century for producing great
mathematicians. What many people in the USA probably don't know is that the two
countries have also been close partners geopolitically, and that one way this
partnership has played out is that Indians have become fans of Russian math
texts. The result is that a large portion of the Russian math texts translated
into English are really only available in the Indian market.
