# MathStudy

Info on resources for studying math, stats, CS, etc.

I created this list for my own studies. I haven't read most of the books here yet, and probably never will read most of them. I've left it visible to the public, though, in case anyone else finds it useful. I make no promises: it may be full of bad advice and it probably contains some erroneous statements about points of fact.

I've also left out some subjects, like combinatorics. I hope to make the list more complete in the future. I also hope in the future to present a simpler list of "here's a list of books you can work through to cover all these subjects without repeating the same material too much or spending too much money".

## Annotations

- (u) - This book is very expensive (price > $100), but used copies can be bought for a reasonable price.
- (x) - This book is very expensive (price > $100), and used copies *cannot* [at the time of writing] be bought for a reasonable price.
- (f) - This book is available free online.
- (i) - This book is very expensive (price > $100), but there is an affordable international edition.
- (c) - This book is relatively inexpensive (price < $30) when bought new.
- (o) - An acceptable edition of this book that's previous to the current one but not terribly out of date can be bought for considerably cheaper than the current edition.

## Sections

I'm not sure how well I chose the sections here, but at least they break the list up into more manageable chunks.

### [Calculus](Calculus.md)
### [Analysis](Analysis.md)
### [Probability, Statistics and Machine Learning](ProbStats.md)
### [Algebra](Algebra.md)
### [Geometry and Topology](GeomTopo.md)
### [Logic and Discrete Math](LogicDiscrete.md)
### [Computer Science](CS.md)
### [School level (pre-calculus) mathematics](SchoolLevel.md)
