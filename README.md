## Calculus

Probably the best conventional calculus textbook is Leithold's TC7 (The Calculus, 7th edition). It's a "1000-page monster" style book with exposition, proofs and exercises for the standard calculus sequence. I feel that it's very good up until the introduction of vectors; at that point, I'm not sure if the single chapter crash course in linear algebra is sufficient to grasp the subject. This seems to be a common problem with multivariate calculus texts, and I think the best solution is to get a proper introduction to linear algebra first.

MIT OCW has a pretty good series of lectures for calculus of a single variable that should go well with Leithold.

A more advanced choice is Apostol's Calculus volumes I and II. MIT uses this as the text for their honors calculus course. It's very good, and goes deeper into the background of the math you're learning, but I think it's probably best in combination with a book like Leithold's.

Leithold has been called a fairly demanding book. Personally, I think its clarity and wealth of examples would benefit any learner. However, for a more intuitive approach to the concepts of calculus, one book that might help is Thompson and Gardners's *Calculus Made Easy*. This one isn't really adequate as your sole textbook, but it does a good job of spoonfeeding you the intuitions of calculus.

Some people swear by Morris Kline's *Calculus: An Intuitive and Physical Approach*. It supposedly gives you a more intuitive understanding of calculus, as the title suggests. I haven't seen this book myself. The Dover edition is less than $20, though.

Other online lecture offerings include ones from Ohio State and Khan Academy. Both seemed a bit slow and basic for my taste, whereas MIT's was more my speed, but then again I already took calculus I in high school so I wasn't starting from scratch.

For more practice problems, many people rely on Schaum's Outlines and Schaum's 3,000 Solved Problems in Calculus. The University of Wisconsin-Madison also has free calculus texts that you can get online; they don't look at all adequate as stand-alone texts for self study, but they do have problems with some solutions included.
