# MathStudy
Info on resources for studying math, stats, CS, etc.

I created this list for my own studies. I haven't read most of the books here yet, and probably never will read most of them. I've left it visible to the public, though, in case anyone else finds it useful. I make no promises; it may be full of bad advice and it probably contains some erroneous statements about points of fact.

## Probability

- Pitman, Probability

Sheldon Ross
- A First Course in Probability
- [A Second Course in Probability]
- Introduction to Probability Models
- Stochastic Processes

Karlin and Taylor
- A First Course in Stochastic Processes
- A Second Course in Stochastic Processes
- An Introduction to Stochastic Modeling (3e preferred)

## Calculus

Probably the best conventional calculus textbook is Leithold's *TC7* (*The Calculus, 7th edition*). It's a "1000-page monster" style book with exposition, proofs and exercises for the standard calculus sequence. I feel that it's very good up until the introduction of vectors; at that point, I'm not sure if the single chapter crash course in linear algebra is sufficient to grasp the subject. This seems to be a common problem with multivariate calculus texts, and I think the best solution is to get a proper introduction to linear algebra first.

MIT OCW has a series of online lectures for calculus. The lecturing isn't outstanding, but the material covered is good for the most part. The lectures can be watched on YouTube here:

Gilbert Strang wrote a textbook that can go with it. It's available for free online here:
- http://ocw.mit.edu/ans7870/resources/Strang/Edited/Calculus/Calculus.pdf

A more advanced choice is Apostol's *Calculus* Volumes I and II. MIT uses this as the text for their honors calculus course. It's very good, and goes deeper into the background of the math you're learning, but I think it's probably best in combination with a book like Leithold's. (I'm not sure if Volume II is really worthwhile, though. I'll decide that once I've read it.)

Leithold has been called a fairly demanding book. Personally, I think its clarity and wealth of examples would benefit any learner. However, for a more intuitive approach to the concepts of calculus, one book that might help is Thompson and Gardners's *Calculus Made Easy*. This one isn't really adequate as your sole textbook, but it does a good job of spoonfeeding you the intuitions of calculus.

Some people swear by Morris Kline's *Calculus: An Intuitive and Physical Approach*. It supposedly gives you a more intuitive understanding of calculus, as the title suggests. The Dover edition is less than $20. It's a bit old-fashioned but it seems good enough. I'll have more to say once I've spent more time reading it.

An interesting-looking recent book designed for high school students who want to study calculus on their own is *Calculus for the Ambitious*, by T. W. Körner. CUP's promotion says, "In a lively and easy-to-read style, Professor Körner uses approximation and estimates in a way that will easily merge into the standard development of analysis. By using Taylor's theorem with error bounds he is able to discuss topics that are rarely covered at this introductory level." I haven't seen this book in the flesh yet, but it's inexpensive.

Other online lecture offerings include ones from Ohio State and Khan Academy. Both seemed a bit slow and basic for my taste, whereas MIT's was more my speed, but then again I already took calculus I in high school so I wasn't starting from scratch.

For more practice problems, many people rely on Schaum's Outlines and *Schaum's 3,000 Solved Problems in Calculus*. The University of Wisconsin-Madison also has free calculus texts that you can get online; they don't look at all adequate as stand-alone texts for self study, but they do have problems with some solutions included.

For multivariate calculus, there seems to be a general consensus that the texts that teach "all" of calculus don't do a great job with it. (Leithold, for example, stops giving so many proofs at that point in the curriculum and states that they belong in a book dedicated to the subject.) The following texts are dedicated to this part of the calculus curriculum in particular (arranged in descending order according to my impression of their usefulness):

- Hubbard and Hubbard, *Vector Calculus, Linear Algebra and Differential Forms: A Unified Approach*
- Schey, *Div, Grad, Curl and All That*
- Baxandall and Liebeck, *Vector Calculus*
- Friedman, *Advanced Calculus*
- Edwards, *Advanced Calculus of Several Variables*

*The Feynman Lectures* also discuss vector calculus in the context of electromagnetism, which is supposedly a great way to tie it in with your understanding of the physical, if you already have some background in physics.

### Calculus problem books

It may be that the problems in whatever textbook you're using don't give you as much practice as you want. One option is to get another textbook and do the problems from that, too. However, there are a number of books dedicated to providing problems. One advantage to these is that they generally tend to give you explanations of how to solve them as well.

- Demidovich, *Problems in mathematical analysis* [can be found online]
- Maron, *Problems in Calculus of One Variable*
- Mendelson, *Schaum's 3,000 Solved Problems in Calculus* [reportedly has some errors]
- Kelley, *The Humongous Book of Calculus Problems*

John Erdman of Portland State University has posted a number of free problem books as PDFs on his website (answers to odd-numbered exercises given): http://web.pdx.edu/~erdman/

## Analysis

The big question that arises almost every time someone asks for an analysis text is, Rudin or not Rudin? I think the answer is, yes. Read his books, and read some others too in case you didn't get what Rudin was talking about.

### Real Analysis
- Johnsonbaugh and Pfaffenberger, *Foundations of Mathematical Analysis*
- Apostol, *Mathematical Analysis*
- Rudin, *Principles of Mathematical Analysis*
- Shilov and Gurevich, *Integral, Measure and Derivative: A Unified Approach*

In struggling with Rudin's *Principles of Mathematical Analysis* (aka "Baby "Rudin"), I found various supplements and partial solutions manuals online. Of these, most were not very helpful; often, I had actually worked out the same proof that the they showed, but I didn't understand how it served to prove the premise and the solution came with no explanation. (That's still some help; though: if I have some reassurance that I've seen the statement that's necessary for the proof, then I know I'm on the right track.)

The one resource that I did find most helpful is George Bergman's "Supplements", which has commentary on Rudin's text as well as the exercises [https://math.berkeley.edu/~gbergman/ug.hndts/m104_Rudin_exs.pdf]. Bergman also wrote up his own errata listing things he wanted Rudin to change in the book: [https://math.berkeley.edu/~gbergman/ug.hndts/m104_Rudin_notes.pdf].

UW-Madison hosts a solution manual by Roger Cooke, [http://minds.wisconsin.edu/handle/1793/67009]; this wasn't always thorough enough, but it was of some help.
