# MathStudy
Info on resources for studying math, stats, CS, etc.

I created this list for my own studies. I haven't read most of the books here yet, and probably never will read most of them. I've left it visible to the public, though, in case anyone else finds it useful. I make no promises: it may be full of bad advice and it probably contains some erroneous statements about points of fact.

## Calculus

There are two major camps of introductory calculus textbooks: the "standard" textbooks like Stewart that most major universities use, and the "elite" textbooks like Spivak and Apostol that are typically used in elite universities and honors courses. The standard books are new, updated frequently, fat (1000 pages), full of glossy diagrams and applications problems, but light on theory and proofs. The elite textbooks are old (usually), rarely updated, thinner, more sparsely illustrated, and they emphasize theory from the ground up beginning with the real number system while having fewer calculation problems and applications problems (no applications, in some cases).

### Standard calculus textbooks

- Leithold, *TC7* (*The Calculus, 7th edition*)
  
  Louis Leithold was widely credited with the creation of the modern "standard" calculus textbook. This is either a great accomplishment ("improving math education") or an unforgivable sin ("dumbing down mathematics"), depending on which side of the textbook feud you fall on. In any case, he's dead now, and his book isn't popular enough to attract a successor to maintain it, so this one probably won't get any new editions. In my opinion, it is actually more "proofy" compared to the other books in this section. There is an older but perfectly good edition, *The Calculus With Analytic Geometry* (TCWAG) which is currently available for under $10.

  My personal opinion is that if you're going to get a "standard" calc textbook, Leithold is a good choice. Don't expect much from its theoretical demands, though: it does a fine job of teaching the proofs but the proofs you're asked to do in the problem sets are dull and trivial. The calculation problems are also a bit repetitive.

- Stewart, *Calculus: Early Transcendentals* (o)

  Stewart is the flagship of the standard calc textbook movement. It has a huge adoption in both high schools and universities, and a new version is released every few years. It is also probably the most widely lambasted calculus textbook, besides possibly Finney and Thomas. Overall, it does a fine job as far as you can expect from this type of book: many college instructors prefer it to other, similar books. Its frequent revisions (now prepared by others since Stewart died) have been blamed for exploiting students by keeping book prices high, but this has the convenient consequence for self-learners that they can pick up recent but still-perfectly-good older editions on the used market for very cheap. (The revisions mostly concern problem sets, so a student actually enrolled in a course needs to use the required edition.)

Other textbooks in this category that I will not discuss at length are:

- Thomas et al, *Thomas' Calculus* (Thomas retired in 1978, and editions since then have different co-authors.)
- Lial, Greenwell et al, *Calculus with Applications*
- Anton and Bivens, *Calculus*

### Elite calculus textbooks

- Spivak, *Calculus*

  Spivak is the most revered of this class of textbooks. It's also the most current: its fourth edition was published in 2008. Spivak chatty, conversational style. The book begins by establishing the properties of the real number system, and covers limits, differential and integral calculus, and infinite sequences. Unlike the books that follow, Spivak does not deal with calculus of several variables, so you need another book for that. (He has written a book on that subject, *Calculus on Manifolds, but it's not considered an introductory book.) Spivak's book has also been called an introduction to analysis; you might all call it "calculus for mathematicians".

- Apostol, *Calculus*, volumes I and II

  Apostol is, according to my own rather cursory research, the most widely used of this class of textbooks in college classrooms. Volume I in particular is excellent. The language is much more typical "math-speak" than Spivak's, but the approaches to the material are unusual. Apostol begins with integration before covering limits and differential calculus. This approach works, but it is incovenient if you're trying to use it in combination with another textbook or an online course, since almost all other courses follow the order limits-derivatives-integrals. Apostol's problem sets are excellent, perhaps the best of the bunch. Chapter 1 in particular is a crash course in proof by induction that will very quickly get you comfortable with manipulating sums.
  
  Volume II introduces linear algebra and calculus of several variables. It is often regarded as not as good as Volume I, particularly because its presentation of linear alegebra is dated. However, it does cover some interesting topics not often seen in a calculus textbook: systems of differential equations, probability, and numerical analysis (i.e. approximation methods).

- Courant, *Differential and Integral Calculus*, volumes I and II

  Richard Courant, who died in 1972, was a highly respected German-American mathematician. With Herbert Robbins, he also wrote *What is Mathematics?*, a remarkable work that attempts to explain a large swathe of mathematics to a popular audience. This calculus textbook is particularly noted for its wealth of physics applications, making it by far the most "applied" of this group. However, its problems are also notoriously difficult, so much so that they're not really appropriate for a learner at this level, at least not without a supplement of easier problems to practice with.
  
  Since Courant has been dead for several decades, a newer edition was published with Fritz John as co-author. That edition is also highly respected. The most notable difference is that Courant and John splits Volume II into two parts and adds several sections of new material.

### Other textbooks of note

These books are ones that I'd consider somehow "in between" the other two groups.

- Strang, *Calculus* (f)
  
  A free textbook, available from MIT's OCW website here along with some other information:
  http://ocw.mit.edu/resources/res-18-001-calculus-online-textbook-spring-2005/textbook/

  Here's a direct link to the PDF: http://ocw.mit.edu/ans7870/resources/Strang/Edited/Calculus/Calculus.pdf
  
  Strang's book is in some ways a "standard" textbook in that it stresses intuitive understanding and physical applications, but it has an undeniable charm, and Strang is one of the great math educators of our time.

- Thomas, *Calculus and Analytic Geometry* (c)

  This entry refers to the original series of textbooks written by George B. Thomas himself, up to the Fourth Edition. As of 2015 they can still be bought used (quite cheap!), and thanks to the durable hardback bindings they used in those days, you can probably still find them in good condition. (Just hope some jerk didn't scribble all over your copy.) Depending on who you ask, the pinnacle of the series is either the 4th Edition or the 3rd Alternate Edition.
  
  As advertised, there is a strong emphasis here on analytic geometry and applications. Thomas taught at MIT, and this is clearly a "calculus for engineers" approach.

- Lang, *A First Course in Calculus* (o)

  Serge Lang is famous for his difficult graduate-level texts in a dozen different subjects, but he has also put his hand to writing a handful of textbooks for lower levels of math. Of those, probably the most successful is this, his calculus book.

- Kline, *Calculus: An Intuitive and Physical Approach* (c)
- Thompson and Gardner, *Calculus Made Easy* (c)
- 
- Körner, *Calculus for the Ambitious* (c)

  CUP's promotion says, "In a lively and easy-to-read style, Professor Körner uses approximation and estimates in a way that will easily merge into the standard development of analysis. By using Taylor's theorem with error bounds he is able to discuss topics that are rarely covered at this introductory level." I haven't seen this book in the flesh yet, but it's inexpensive.

### Online calculus resources

MIT OCW has a series of online lectures for calculus. The lecturing isn't outstanding, but the material covered is good for the most part. The lectures can be watched on YouTube here:
- https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL590CCC2BC5AF3BC1
- https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL4C4C8A7D06566F38

Other online lecture offerings include ones from Ohio State and Khan Academy. Both seemed a bit slow and basic for my taste, whereas MIT's was more my speed, but then again I already took calculus I in high school so I wasn't starting from scratch.

For more practice problems, many people rely on Schaum's Outlines and *Schaum's 3,000 Solved Problems in Calculus*. The University of Wisconsin-Madison also has free calculus texts that you can get online; they don't look at all adequate as stand-alone texts for self study, but they do have problems with some solutions included.

For multivariate calculus, there seems to be a general consensus that the texts that teach "all" of calculus don't do a great job with it. (Leithold, for example, stops giving so many proofs at that point in the curriculum and states that they belong in a book dedicated to the subject.) The following texts are dedicated to this part of the calculus curriculum in particular (arranged in descending order according to my impression of their usefulness):

- Hubbard and Hubbard, *Vector Calculus, Linear Algebra and Differential Forms: A Unified Approach*
- Schey, *Div, Grad, Curl and All That* (o)
- Baxandall and Liebeck, *Vector Calculus* (c)
- Friedman, *Advanced Calculus* (c)
- Edwards, *Advanced Calculus of Several Variables* (c)

*The Feynman Lectures* also discuss vector calculus in the context of electromagnetism, which is supposedly a great way to tie it in with your understanding of the physical, if you already have some background in physics.

### Calculus problem books

It may be that the problems in whatever textbook you're using don't give you as much practice as you want. One option is to get another textbook and do the problems from that, too. However, there are a number of books dedicated to providing problems. One advantage to these is that they generally tend to give you explanations of how to solve them as well.

- Demidovich, *Problems in mathematical analysis* [can be found online]
- Maron, *Problems in Calculus of One Variable* (c)
- Mendelson, *Schaum's 3,000 Solved Problems in Calculus* (c) [reportedly has some errors]

## Analysis

The big question that arises almost every time someone asks for an analysis text is, Rudin or not Rudin? I think the answer is, yes. Read his books, and read some others too in case you didn't get what Rudin was talking about.

### Real Analysis

#### Proofs books

These aren't actually analysis books, but in the math curriculum that's often where they get used, since intro to real analysis is often the place where math students start to write (and really have to understand) proofs.

- Solow, *How to Read and Do Proofs: An Introduction to Mathematical Thought Processes*
- Velleman, *How to Prove It* (c/o)

#### Books to hold your hand

These books ease you into real analysis. They are designed to address a difficulty in the evolving US math curriculum, namely that because rigorous calculus textbooks (like Spivak and Apostol) are no longer commonly used in lower-level courses, students arrive in real analysis courses without knowing how to read and write proofs or understanding the theoretical foundation of calculus. These books help you with understanding how to do proofs, and they feed you the information in a way that's easier to digest. They don't cover all the material you need, and thus they aren't sufficient on their own to master the subject, but they can make the other books (which I call "standard" below) more manageable.

- Alcock, *How to Think About Analysis*

  This book begins with a discussion of how to read a math book. This might seem like a trivial thing to discuss, but it is a real problem for many people because math books are presented in a way that requires a lot of engagement on the part of the reader. Many students are not prepared when they encounter a book that is full of proofs and not much else. Alcock covers topics like how to relate theorems to definitions, and even how to study. The remainder of the book introduces major topics in analysis: sequences, series, continuity, differentiability, integrability, the real numbers. This book is written in such an elementary manner that it has a bit of a "for dummies" feel to it (though it's never condescening or childish), but if you can swallow your pride, there's a lot of good information here.

- Schramm, *Introduction to Real Analysis* (c)

  Schramm begins with a section on how to write proofs. What's really notable about the rest of the book is that he discusses how a number of major theorems of real analysis are essentially equivalent, and he shows you how to establish this equivalence. He wraps up by constructing the real number system via Dedekind cuts, which is a sensible transition to a book like Rudin that begins with Dedekind cuts.

- Ross, *Elementary Analysis: The Theory of Calculus*

  Ross eases you into real analysis by removing the hardest material from the course (like measure) and putting extra emphasis on the fundamental topics. The book uses a decent number of illustrations when discussing basic topology.

- Abbot, *Understanding Analysis*

  Abbot's book is more a traditional real analysis book that the others in this section. It doesn't include chapters teaching you how to do mathemetics. The reason that I don't classify it with the "standard" textbooks is that it stops short of measure theory and the Lebesgue integral. For the material that he does cover, though, his explanations are good.

#### Historical approach

- Bressoud, *A Radical Approach to Real Analysis*
- Bressoud, *A Radical Approach to Lebesgue's Theory of Integration*

  I discuss both of these books by Bressoud together. Bressoud's concept is to teach analysis by tracing the history of the mathematical concepts, and the telling the story of the problems and controversies that played out over the course of the 19th Century that gave shape to modern analysis. He states that his main purpose is to teach you the math, though, not to teach you the history of mathematics.

  Bressoud summarizes *A Radical Approach to Real Analysis* thus: "The book begins with Fourier's introduction of trigonometric series and the problems they created for the mathematicians of the early nineteenth century. It follows Cauchy's attempts to establish a firm foundation for calculus, and considers his failures as well as his successes. It culminates with Dirichlet's proof of the validity of the Fourier series expansion and explores some of the counterintuitive results Riemann and Weierstrass were led to as a result of Dirichlet's proof."

  The second book is summarized thus: "The story begins with Riemann's definition of the integral, a definition created so that he could understand how broadly one could define a function and yet have it be integrable. The reader then follows the efforts of many mathematicians who wrestled with the difficulties inherent in the Riemann integral, leading to the work in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries of Jordan, Borel, and Lebesgue, who finally broke with Riemann's definition. Ushering in a new way of understanding integration, they opened the door to fresh and productive approaches to many of the previously intractable problems of analysis."

#### Standard books

- Rudin, *Principles of Mathematical Analysis* (u/i)

  AKA "Baby Rudin". The definitive book on real analysis. For some, it's the yardstick by which all other real analysis textbooks are measured, and found wanting. (For others, it's a work of elitist arrogance designed to make you feel inferior to the author.) Rudin expects you to keep up with him, and makes no apologies if you don't. The book is carefully constructed, though, so that at each step you have the definitions and theorems needed to proceed. This approach requires a lot of work from you as reader, but it does pay off. His exercises are demanding, but they force you to engage the material on another level and really understand it.

  If you don't have experience reading serious math books, one of the "hand-holding" books mentioned above is strongly suggested. Those authors no doubt had this book in mind as one of the texts that they intended to prepare you for.

  Most students will use some other textbook along with Rudin. Pretty much any of the other books mentioned here makes a suitable counterpoint to Rudin's style and fills in many of the details that he glosses over.

  In struggling with Rudin, I found various supplements and partial solutions manuals online. Of these, most were not very helpful; often, I had actually worked out the same proof that the they showed, but I didn't understand how it served to prove the premise and the solution came with no explanation. (That's still some help; though: if I have some reassurance that I've seen the statement that's necessary for the proof, then I know I'm on the right track.)

  The one resource that I did find most helpful is George Bergman's "Supplements", which has commentary on Rudin's text as well as the exercises [https://math.berkeley.edu/~gbergman/ug.hndts/m104_Rudin_exs.pdf]. Bergman also wrote up his own errata listing things he had asked Rudin to change: [https://math.berkeley.edu/~gbergman/ug.hndts/m104_Rudin_notes.pdf].

  UW-Madison hosts a solution manual by Roger Cooke, [http://minds.wisconsin.edu/handle/1793/67009]; this wasn't always thorough enough, but it was of some help.

- Apostol, *Mathematical Analysis*

  Another classic text (1974), with more extensive explanations than Rudin.

- Johnsonbaugh and Pfaffenberger, *Foundations of Mathematical Analysis* (c)
- Kolmogorov and Fomin, *Introductory Real Analysis* (c)
- Pugh, *Real Mathematical Analysis*

  Notable for its many exercises. It contains many illustrations, but I find most of them to be poorly chosen, as if the author recognizes that illustrations are good to have but doesn't grasp how to use them to illustrate concepts.

- Taylor, *General Theory of Functions and Integration* (c)

  Another classic text (1965). It is notable clear in its explanations.

#### Fourier analysis

### More real analysis

- Royden (3e preferred)

  Royden is another classic real analyis text. One thing to be aware of is that a fourth edition was published with Patrick Fitzpatrick as co-author, but it hasn't been well-received: many felt that the third edition was in no need of revision, and the fourth introduced new errors. Since it was popular, many copies of the 3rd edition (of 1988) are still available on the used market.
