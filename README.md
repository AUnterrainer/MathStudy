# MathStudy
Info on resources for studying math, stats, CS, etc.

I created this list for my own studies. I haven't read most of the books here yet, and probably never will read most of them. I've left it visible to the public, though, in case anyone else finds it useful. I make no promises: it may be full of bad advice and it probably contains some erroneous statements about points of fact.

## Annotations

## Sections

I'm not sure how well I chose the sections here, but at least they break the list up into more manageable chunks.

### [Elementary mathematics](SchoolLevel.md)
### [Calculus](Calculus.md)
### [Analysis](Analysis.md)
### [Probability and Statistics](ProbabilityAndStatistics.md)
### [Algebra](Algebra.md)
### [Geometry and Topology](GeometryAndTopology.md)
