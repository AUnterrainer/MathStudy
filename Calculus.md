## Calculus

There are two major camps of introductory calculus textbooks: the "standard" textbooks like Stewart that most major universities use, and the "elite" textbooks like Spivak and Apostol that are typically used in elite universities and honors courses. The standard books are new, updated frequently, fat (1000 pages), full of glossy diagrams and applications problems, but light on theory and proofs. The elite textbooks are old (usually), rarely updated, thinner, more sparsely illustrated, and they emphasize theory from the ground up beginning with the real number system while having fewer calculation problems and applications problems (no applications, in some cases).

### Standard calculus textbooks

- Leithold, *TC7* (*The Calculus, 7th edition*) ([TC7](https://www.amazon.com/dp/0673469131), [TCWAG 6](https://www.amazon.com/dp/0060441070))
  
  Louis Leithold was widely credited with the creation of the modern "standard" calculus textbook. This is either a great accomplishment ("improving math education") or an unforgivable sin ("dumbing down mathematics"), depending on which side of the textbook feud you fall on. In any case, he's dead now, and his book isn't popular enough to attract a successor to maintain it, so this one probably won't get any new editions. In my opinion, it is actually more "proofy" compared to the other books in this section. There is an older but perfectly good edition, *The Calculus With Analytic Geometry* (TCWAG) which is currently available for under $10.

  My personal opinion is that if you're going to get a "standard" calc textbook, Leithold is a good choice. Don't expect much from its theoretical demands, though: it does a fine job of teaching the proofs but the proofs you're asked to do in the problem sets are dull and trivial. The calculation problems are also a bit repetitive.

- Stewart, *Calculus: Early Transcendentals* ([5e](https://www.amazon.com/dp/0534393217))

  Stewart is the flagship of the standard calc textbook movement. It has a huge adoption in both high schools and universities, and a new version is released every few years. It is also probably the most widely lambasted calculus textbook, besides possibly Finney and Thomas. Overall, it does a fine job as far as you can expect from this type of book: many college instructors prefer it to other, similar books. Its frequent revisions (now prepared by others since Stewart died) have been blamed for exploiting students by keeping book prices high, but this has the convenient consequence for self-learners that they can pick up recent but still-perfectly-good older editions on the used market for very cheap. (The revisions mostly concern problem sets, so a student actually enrolled in a course needs to use the required edition.)

Other textbooks in this category that I will not discuss at length are:

- Thomas et al. *Thomas' Calculus* ([12e](https://smile.amazon.com/dp/0321587995)) [Upd 10e](https://smile.amazon.com/dp/0201755270) (Thomas retired in 1978, and editions since then have different co-authors.)
- Lial, Greenwell et al. *Calculus with Applications* ([9e](https://www.amazon.com/dp/0321421329))
- Anton and Bivens. *Calculus* ([7e](https://www.amazon.com/dp/047138156X), [7e Student Resource Manual](https://www.amazon.com/dp/0471441724))
- Larson, Hostetler, Edwards. *Calculus* ([8e](https://www.amazon.com/dp/061850298X/), [7e](https://www.amazon.com/dp/0618141804))

### Elite calculus textbooks

- Spivak, *Calculus*

  Spivak is the most revered of this class of textbooks. It's also the most current: its fourth edition was published in 2008. Spivak has a chatty, conversational style. The book begins by establishing the properties of the real number system, and covers limits, differential and integral calculus, and infinite sequences. Unlike the books that follow, Spivak does not deal with calculus of several variables, so you need another book for that. (He has written a book on that subject, *Calculus on Manifolds*, but it's not considered an introductory book.) Spivak's book has been called an introduction to analysis; you might also call it "calculus for mathematicians".

- Apostol, *Calculus*, volumes I and II ([Vol I](https://smile.amazon.com/dp/0471000051), [Vol I intl](https://smile.amazon.com/dp/8126515198/), [Vol II](https://smile.amazon.com/dp/0471000078), [Vol II intl](https://smile.amazon.com/dp/8126515201))

  Apostol is, according to my own rather cursory research, the most widely used of this class of textbooks in college classrooms. Volume I in particular is excellent. The language is much more typical "math-speak" than Spivak's, but the approaches to the material are unusual. Apostol begins with integration before covering limits and differential calculus. This approach works, but it is incovenient if you're trying to use it in combination with another textbook or an online course, since almost all other courses follow the order limits-derivatives-integrals. Apostol's problem sets are excellent, perhaps the best of the bunch. Chapter 1 in particular is a crash course in proof by induction that will very quickly get you comfortable with manipulating sums.
  
  Volume II introduces linear algebra and calculus of several variables. It is often regarded as not as good as Volume I, particularly because its presentation of linear alegebra is dated. However, it does cover some interesting topics not often seen in a calculus textbook: systems of differential equations, probability, and numerical analysis (i.e. approximation methods).
  
  The standard edition of these books is, unfortunately, exhorbitantly expensive. However, at least the physical quality of the books is extremely good (the one I have is at least).

- Courant, *Differential and Integral Calculus*, volumes I and II

  - Courant (original). [Vol II](https://smile.amazon.com//dp/487187835X)
  - Courant (Wiley 2nd edition). [Vol I](https://smile.amazon.com/dp/0471608424) [Vol II](https://smile.amazon.com/dp/0471178535)
  - Courant and John (Springer). [Vol I](https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/354065058X), [Vol II/1](https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/3540665692), [Vol II/2](https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/3540665706/)

  Richard Courant, who died in 1972, was a highly respected German-American mathematician. With Herbert Robbins, he also wrote *What is Mathematics?*, a remarkable work that attempts to explain a large swathe of mathematics to a popular audience. This calculus textbook is particularly noted for its wealth of physics applications, making it by far the most "applied" of this group. However, its problems are also notoriously difficult, so much so that they're not really appropriate for a learner at this level, at least not without a supplement of easier problems to practice with.
  
  Since Courant has been dead for several decades, a newer edition was published (by Springer) with Fritz John as co-author. That edition is also highly respected. The most notable difference is that Courant and John splits Volume II into two parts and adds several sections of new material.

### Other textbooks of note

These books are ones that I'd consider somehow "in between" the other two groups.

- Strang, *Calculus* (f)
  
  A free textbook, available from MIT's OCW website here along with some other information:
  http://ocw.mit.edu/resources/res-18-001-calculus-online-textbook-spring-2005/textbook/

  Here's a direct link to the PDF: http://ocw.mit.edu/ans7870/resources/Strang/Edited/Calculus/Calculus.pdf
  
  Strang's book is in some ways a "standard" textbook in that it stresses intuitive understanding and physical applications, but it has an undeniable charm, and Strang is one of the great math educators of our time.

- Thomas, *Calculus and Analytic Geometry* (c) [3rd Alternate](https://smile.amazon.com/dp/B000K1UMJS)

  This entry refers to the original series of textbooks written by George B. Thomas himself, up to the Fourth Edition (1969). As of 2015 they can still be bought used (quite cheap!), and thanks to the durable hardback bindings they used in those days, you can probably still find them in good condition. (Just hope some jerk didn't scribble all over your copy.) Depending on who you ask, the pinnacle of the series was either the 4th Edition or the 3rd Alternate Edition.

  As advertised, there is a strong emphasis here on analytic geometry and applications. Thomas taught at MIT, and this is clearly a "calculus for engineers" approach.

- Kline, *Calculus: An Intuitive and Physical Approach* ([Dover](https://smile.amazon.com/dp/0486404536))

  The title pretty much says what this is. It's older (originally published in 1967, updated in 1977), and was written by Morris Kline, a prolific writer on mathematics who authored several books for a popular audience. In content, this is also what you might class as a "standard" calculus textbook, but it has a different flavor because it was written in a different era.

- Lang, *A First Course in Calculus* ([5e](https://smile.amazon.com/dp/0387962018), [Short Calculus](https://smile.amazon.com/dp/0387953272), [4e @AbeBooks](http://www.abebooks.com/products/isbn/9780201041491))

  Serge Lang is famous for his difficult graduate-level texts in a dozen different subjects, but he has also put his hand to writing a handful of textbooks for lower levels of math. Of those, probably the most successful is this, his calculus book.

  This book is really distinct from all the others here. It is relatively short. It ignores applications to focus on equations, but it is not really a rigorous textbook either. It has proofs, but only the ones that Lang thought were essential. It simply covers the topics of calculus in a clear and straightforward manner. There have been five editions, and each added more material (getting longer), until Lang actually brought back the original edition under the title *Short Calculus*. I have the Fourth Edition.

  Because of its focus on the standard topics without a bunch of fuss over applications, this is currently my preferred reference for anything that it covers.

- Thompson and Gardner, *Calculus Made Easy* ([Revised](https://smile.amazon.com/Calculus-Made-Easy-Silvanus-Thompson/dp/0312185480))

  An intuitive introduction to calculus. This isn't thorough enough to be a course textbook, but it makes a good companion to a textbook. It's for someone who's just beginning calculus. The original version (by just Thompson) is in the public domain. It's shorter and some people feel that it does a better job of keeping things simple. You can get it online here: https://archive.org/details/CalculusMadeEasy

- Körner, *Calculus for the Ambitious* ([1e](https://smile.amazon.com/dp/1107063922))

  CUP's promotion says, "In a lively and easy-to-read style, Professor Körner uses approximation and estimates in a way that will easily merge into the standard development of analysis. By using Taylor's theorem with error bounds he is able to discuss topics that are rarely covered at this introductory level." I haven't seen this book in the flesh yet, but it's inexpensive.
  
- Shahriari, *Approximately Calculus*

  This is intended as a second book on calculus. It's full of difficult problems that push your theoretical understanding of calculus, approaching the topic in unusual ways. It's probably more in line with books like Spivak in its intentions.

### Online calculus resources

MIT OCW has a series of online lectures for calculus. The lecturing isn't outstanding, but the material covered is good for the most part. The lectures can be watched on YouTube here:
- https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL590CCC2BC5AF3BC1
- https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL4C4C8A7D06566F38

Other online lecture offerings include ones from [Ohio State](https://mslc.osu.edu/online/lessons) and [Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/). Both seemed a bit slow and basic for my taste, whereas MIT's was more my speed, but then again I'd already taken some calculus in high school so I wasn't starting from scratch.

The University of Wisconsin-Madison also has free calculus texts that you can get online; they don't look at all adequate as stand-alone texts for self study, but they do have problems with some solutions included. Whitman College also has free calculus texts.

### Calculus of several variables

For multivariate calculus, there seems to be a general consensus that the texts that teach "all" of calculus don't do a great job with it. (Leithold, for example, stops giving so many proofs at that point in the curriculum and states that they belong in a book dedicated to the subject.) The following texts are dedicated to this part of the calculus curriculum in particular (arranged in descending order according to my impression of their usefulness):

- Hubbard and Hubbard, *Vector Calculus, Linear Algebra and Differential Forms: A Unified Approach*
- Schey, *Div, Grad, Curl and All That* (o)
- Baxandall and Liebeck, *Vector Calculus* (c)
- Friedman, *Advanced Calculus* (c)
- C. E. Edwards. *Advanced Calculus of Several Variables*
- H. M. Edwards. *Advanced Calculus: A Differential Forms Approach* ([3e, 2014 reissue](https://www.amazon.com/Advanced-Calculus-Differential-Approach-Birkhäuser/dp/0817684115), [3e, 1994](https://www.amazon.com/Advanced-Calculus-Differential-Forms-Approach/dp/0817637079))
- Shifrin, *Multivariable Mathematics: Linear Algebra, Multivariable Calculus, and Manifolds* (u)

*The Feynman Lectures* also discuss vector calculus in the context of electromagnetism, which is supposedly a great way to tie it in with your understanding of the physical, if you already have some background in physics. See [Physics](Sciences.md#physics).

### Calculus problem books

It may be that the problems in whatever textbook you're using don't give you as much practice as you want. One option is to get another textbook and do the problems from that, too. However, there are a number of books dedicated to providing problems. One advantage to these is that they generally tend to give you explanations of how to solve them as well.

- Demidovich, *Problems in mathematical analysis* [can be found online]
- Maron, *Problems in Calculus of One Variable* (c)
- Mendelson, *Schaum's 3,000 Solved Problems in Calculus* (c) [reportedly has some errors]
- Kelley, *The Humongous Book of Calculus Problems* (c)
- Bluman, *Problem Book for First Year Calculus*
- Ash and Ash, *The Calculus Tutoring Book* [TODO: say more about this]

John Erdman of Portland State University has posted a number of free problem books as PDFs on his website (answers to odd-numbered exercises given): http://web.pdx.edu/~erdman/

The term "advanced calculus" seems to be somewhat vague. Sometimes it means calculus of several variables, sometimes it means analysis, sometimes it means applications that become possible after you have a couple of years of calculus under your belt.
