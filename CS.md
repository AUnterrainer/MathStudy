## Computer science

### Theory

* Sipser, 2012 (3e) / 2006 (2e) / 1996 (1e). *Introduction to the Theory of Computation*

  This is the standard intro to CS theory at many (probably most) universities.
  The latest edition is very expensive (even used). Older editions are generally
  good alternatives, because in newer editions Sipser added some new sections
  but he didn't revise the old ones much.

* Hopcroft, Ullman, 1979. *Introduction to Automata Theory, Languages and Computation*

  A classic and influential introduction to computer science theory. Somewhat more challenging than Sipser.

* Cohen, 1991. *Introduction to Computer Theory*

  Another classic, this one is known for its readability.

* Kinber, Smith, 2001. *Theory of Computing: A Gentle Introduction*

  This is a shorter book, which might be appealing if you're in a hurry.
  It covers finite automata, context-free languages, Turing machines, undecidability
  and computational complexity, devoting 20-40 pages to each of these topics.
  It costs too much, though; for the price, you might as well buy Sipser's 2nd Edition.

### Algorithms

* Cormen, Leiserson, Rivest, Stein, 2009. *Introduction to Algorithms, Third Edition*

  * Cormen, Leiserson, Rivest, Stein, 2001. *Introduction to Algorithms, Second Edition*
  * Cormen, Leiserson, Rivest, 1990. *Introduction to Algorithms*
  
  This is the standard book on algorithms, and it's a big, fat monster: about 1000 large-format pages.
  Currently it's pretty reasonably priced, though you can still save money by buying one of the older
  editions. There are arguably better approaches for learning the subject, but most people will at
  least want to have this one around as a reference.

* Aho, Hopcroft, Ullman, 1974. *The Design and Analysis of Computer Algorithms*

  A classic book on algorithms. I found the beginning of this one to be not so great for
  learning the material the first time.

* TODO: ALGORITHMS -- Sedgewick, Manber, Knuth, Papadimitriou, Skiena, Aho/Ullman/Upcroft. INTRO -- SICP ( https://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/ ), HTDP ( http://www.htdp.org/ ), others?.

### Programming language theory

* Pierce, *Types and Programming Languages*
* Turbak, Gifford, Sheldon, 2008. *Design Concepts in Programming Languages*
* Winskel, *The Formal Semantics of Programming Languages*
* Slonneger, Kurtz, 1995. *Formal Syntax and Semantics of Programming Languages*
* Mitchell, 1996. *Foundations for Programming Languages*
* Pierce (ed), 2004. *Advanced Topics in Types and Programming Languages*

### Compilers and interpreters

* Krishnamurthi, 2012. *Programming Languages: Application and Interpretation*

  The last version of this incarnation of the book. It goes with an online course, which is available here: https://cs.brown.edu/courses/cs173/2012/
  
  Together, these make an excellent introduction to the design and implementation of programming languages using an interpreter.

* Krishnamurthi, 2015. *Programming and Programming Languages*

  Krishnamurthi's latest incarnation of his intro to PLs.

  This book is under constant revision. Currently the latest stable version is here:
  http://papl.cs.brown.edu/2015/

* Aho, Sethi, Ullman, 2006. *Compilers: Principles, Techniques, and Tools, Second Edition*

  * Aho, Sethi, Ullman, 1986. *Compilers: Principles, Techniques, and Tools*

  This is the standard book in the field of compilers, both as an introduction and as a reference.
  This is one book where it's probably worthwhile to buy the latest edition, since compilers
  *have* changed a lot over the years. (There are even older and cheaper editions, though, as this
  title derives from the even older *Principles of Compiler Design* by Aho and Ullman; they are of
  historical interest.)

* Scott 2015 (4e), 2009 (3e), 2005 (2e), 1999 (1e), *Programming Language Pragmatics*

  This book won't teach you how to build a compiler or interpreter, but it's a great reference on
  lots of topics that come up when designing and implementing them. As such, it's a good *second*
  book on the subject.

* TODO: Aho/Sethi/Ullman, Fischer/LeBlanc, Appel (ML, CWC), Wolfe, EOPL, Muchnick, Cooper/Torczon.
