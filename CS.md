## Computer science

* Sipser, 2012 (3e) / 2006 (2e) / 1996 (1e). *Introduction to the Theory of Computation*

  This is the standard intro to CS theory at many (probably most) universities.
  The latest edition is very expensive (even used). Older editions are generally
  good alternatives, because in newer editions Sipser added some new sections
  but he didn't revise the old ones much.

* Hopcroft, Ullman, 1979. *Introduction to Automata Theory, Languages and Computation*

  A classic and influential introduction to computer science theory. Somewhat more challenging than Sipser.

* Cohen, 1991. *Introduction to Computer Theory*

  Another classic, this one is known for its readability.

* Kinber, Smith, 2001. *Theory of Computing: A Gentle Introduction*

  This is a shorter book, which might be appealing if you're in a hurry.
  It covers finite automata, context-free languages, Turing machines, undecidability
  and computational complexity, devoting 20-40 pages to each of these topics.
  It costs too much, though; for the price, you might as well buy Sipser's 2nd Edition.

* Cormen, Leiserson, Rivest, 1990. *Introduction to Algorithms*

  The standard book on algorithms. A big, fat monster. There are arguably better approaches
  for learning the subject, but most people will want to have this one in addition to whichever
  others they choose.

* Aho, Hopcroft, Ullman, 1974. *The Design and Analysis of Computer Algorithms*

  A classic book on algorithms. I found the beginning of this one to be not so great for
  learning the material the first time.
