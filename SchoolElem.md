## For parents, or reference for kids

- Great Source math series

  I've looked over the first three books in this series and they look really
  good. They are designed as references rather than books that you work through
  from start to finish. They don't have any exercises at all since they are not
  intended to be primary textbooks.

  If you compare the table of contents of each subsequent volume, they appear
  redundant. This is only partly true, however, as the later volumes present
  review material more concisely. For example, the measurement section in Math
  to Learn devotes two pages to customary units (i.e. SAE/imperial) and two to
  metric units, with a number of illustrations dedicated to each and a little
  guide showing you how to line up a ruler when measuring something; Math to
  Know shortens each of these two one page each; and Math at Hand presents both
  customary and metric units on a single page.

## US textbooks

### Major lines of school books

- Scott Foresman
- Go Math!
- Harcourt
- McGraw-Hill My Math
- Math Connects

### UCSMP

I'm interested in what I've read about these, so I include them here. However,
I'm disturbed by the sheer size of them. That is a very bad sign IMO, as there
just isn't that much content to teach at this level. I withhold judgement until
I get my hands on them as see what's in all those pages.

#### Everyday Mathematics

- <https://smile.amazon.com/dp/0076045374>

#### 6-12

- Pre-Transition (pre-pre-algebra) <https://smile.amazon.com/Pre-Transition-Mathematics-University-Chicago-Project/dp/0076185699>
- Transition (pre-algebra) <https://smile.amazon.com/Transition-Mathematics-Ucsmp-Grades-6-12/dp/0076213854>

### Activate Science (Oxford)

I just saw it online and it looked interesting.

## Foreign textbooks

### Singapore Math

Singapore Math is an adaptation of the Singapore math textbooks to the US
market. ("Singapore Math" also refers to the US company that has done this and
sells the books.) There are a few different versions: "US", "Standards" and
"Common Core". From reading the summaries, I gather that the "US" edition has
the least changes from the original, whereas the others add topics to match US
standards. As such, the US version is probably the best, because the point of
these Asian curricula is largely to avoid loading little kids with so many
topics. (The current US edition is older, though, and the books aren't all in
color like the other editions, if that matters. I think it doesn't.)

Official website: <http://www.singaporemath.com/>

You can find them elsewhere but the official site seems as good a place as any
to get them. (It seems that they don't sell through distributors/retailers, so
any books you find elsewhere are probably secondhand.)

Here are some other series that appear to be Singapore Math knockoffs:

- <https://smile.amazon.com/Math-Focus-Singapore-1A-Student/dp/0547875827>
- <https://smile.amazon.com/dp/1483813185>
- <https://smile.amazon.com/Singapore-Math-Practice-Level-Grade/dp/0768239915>
- <https://smile.amazon.com/Singapore-Primary-grade-WORKBOOK-SET-1A/dp/B003AYCOWU>

### Shanghai Mathematics

New English-language editions of the math books used in Shanghai, produced for
use in the UK. They emphasize fewer topics in more depth compared to western
approaches. This project looks intriguing but there aren't any reports out yet
about the results of using them in British schools.

#### Real Shanghai Mathematics

Series from Collins.

Official website: <https://collins.co.uk/page/Real+Shanghai+Mathematics>

These are sold through retailers and you can buy them on Amazon.

#### Shanghai Maths Project

Looks like this was published in 2015. These books are the 1st year set:

- Learner book 1: <https://smile.amazon.com/dp/0008225958>
- Practice book 1A: <https://smile.amazon.com/dp/0008226075>
- Practice book 1B: <https://smile.amazon.com/dp/0008226083>
- Teacher's guide 1: <https://smile.amazon.com/dp/0008197199>

### India NCERT textbooks

India has a government program to produce standard textbooks that can be
reproduced inexpensively. (At least this is what I infer from what I've read on
the website.)

You can preview them here: <http://epathshala.nic.in/e-pathshala-4/flipbook/>

This site actually lets you download the entire books as PDFs, or read them in
the browser, but the PDFs have watermarks.

These books can be bought on Amazon but the copies available in the USA are
expensive. They're cheap in India but I don't know a way to get them shipped to
the USA.
