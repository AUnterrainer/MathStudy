# Logic and Discrete Math

## Logic

* Gensler, *Introduction to Logic*

  This is a really nice first course in logic, which covers all the core material
that you'd want to see in a first course, gives a tour of major philosophical applications of logic,
and also has a nice overview of less mainstream types of logics.

* Franzén, *Gödel's Theorem: An Incomplete Guide to Its Use and Abuse*

## Discrete Math

* Rosen, *Discrete Mathematics and its Applications*

  A pretty standard introduction to discrete math. I like this one because of its computer science focus. Older editions can be bought cheaply.
