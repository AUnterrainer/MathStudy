# Logic and Discrete Math

## Logic

* Gensler, *Introduction to Logic*

  This is a really nice first course in logic, which covers all the core material
that you'd want to see in a first course, gives a tour of major philosophical applications of logic,
and also has a nice overview of less mainstream types of logics.

## Discrete Math

#### Discrete Math for Computer Science

These are generally grab-bags of topics relevant for beginning CS students: logic, proofs, number theory, boolean algebra, combinatorics, graph theory. I only list older, cheap editions. These books tend to be elementary and shallow, because they are devoted to brief coverage of a large variety of topics.

* (FREE) [Harvard CS 20 notes](https://www.seas.harvard.edu/courses/cs20/MIT6_042Notes.pdf)
* Rosen. *Discrete Mathematics and its Applications* ([6e](https://smile.amazon.com/dp/0073229725), [5e](https://smile.amazon.com/dp/0072424346)) - Probably the most popular book of this type.
* Epp. *Discrete Mathematics with Applications* ([3e](https://smile.amazon.com/dp/0534359450), [3e solns](https://smile.amazon.com/Student-dp/0534360289), [2e](https://smile.amazon.com/dp/0534944469)) - Noted for its clarity. Seems to be well-liked by struggling students.
* Grimaldi. *Discrete and Combinatorial Mathematics: An Applied Introduction* ([4e](https://smile.amazon.com/dp/0201199122), [3e](https://smile.amazon.com/dp/B00404GGWI), [2e](https://smile.amazon.com/dp/0201119544)) - Older. Includes some interesting topics in the final chapters.

This one covers a similar range of topics, but is aimed more at math majors.

* Scheinerman. *Mathematics: A Discrete Introduction* ([3e](https://smile.amazon.com/dp/0840049420), [2e](https://smile.amazon.com/dp/0534398987))

These are somewhat more mature approaches to discrete math.

* Graham, Knuth, Patashnik. *Concrete Mathematics: A Foundation for Computer Science* ([2e](https://smile.amazon.com/dp/0201558025))

#### Combinatorics and Graph Theory

* Lovász, Pelikán, Vesztergombi. *Discrete Mathematics: Elementary and Beyond*

* Martin. *Counting: The Art of Enumerative Combinatorics*

* Wilf. *generatingfunctionology* ([**2e FREE ONLINE**](https://www.math.upenn.edu/~wilf/DownldGF.html) [3e](https://smile.amazon.com/generatingfunctionology-Third-Herbert-S-Wilf/dp/1568812795/))

* Chartrand, Zhang. *A First Course in Graph Theory*

* Hartsfield and Ringel. *Pearls in Graph Theory: A Comprehensive Introduction* ([Dover ed](https://smile.amazon.com/dp/0486432327/))

  More in-depth than Chartrand's other intro book.
