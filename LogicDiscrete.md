# Logic and Discrete Math

## Logic

* Gensler, Introduction to Logic

  This is a really nice first course in logic, which covers all the core material
that you'd want to see in a fist course, and also has a nice overview of less
mainstream types of logics.

## Discrete Math

* Rosen, Discrete Mathematics and its Applications

  A pretty standard introduction to discrete math. I like this one because of its computer science focus.
