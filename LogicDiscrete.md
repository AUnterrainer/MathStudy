# Logic and Discrete Math

## Logic

* Gensler, *Introduction to Logic*

  This is a really nice first course in logic, which covers all the core material
that you'd want to see in a first course, gives a tour of major philosophical applications of logic,
and also has a nice overview of less mainstream types of logics.

## Discrete Math

### Introductions

#### Discrete math for computer science

These are generally grab-bags of topics relevant for beginning CS students: logic, proofs, number theory, boolean algebra, combinatorics, graph theory. I only list older, cheap editions. These books tend to be relatively elementary and shallow, because they are devoted to brief coverage of a large variety of topics, but on the other hand they are widely available, polished in their presentation and they have lots of exercises.

Typical topics are: logic and proof, set theory, functions, introduction to algorithms, basic number theory, mathematical induction, counting and discrete probability, other topics in combinatorics, graphs and trees, basic automata theory.

* Lehman, Leighton, Meyer. *Mathematics for Computer Science* (FREE [Harvard CS 20 notes](https://www.seas.harvard.edu/courses/cs20/MIT6_042Notes.pdf))
* Rosen. *Discrete Mathematics and its Applications* ([6e](https://smile.amazon.com/dp/0073229725), [5e](https://smile.amazon.com/dp/0072424346), [5e solns [odd problems only]](https://smile.amazon.com/dp/0072474777)) - Probably the most popular book of this type.
* Epp. *Discrete Mathematics with Applications* ([3e](https://smile.amazon.com/dp/0534359450), [3e solns](https://smile.amazon.com/Student-dp/0534360289), [2e](https://smile.amazon.com/dp/0534944469), [ERRATA](http://condor.depaul.edu/sepp/DMwA3e.htm)) - Noted for its clarity. Seems to be well-liked by struggling students.
* Grimaldi. *Discrete and Combinatorial Mathematics: An Applied Introduction* ([4e](https://smile.amazon.com/dp/0201199122), [3e](https://smile.amazon.com/dp/B00404GGWI), [2e](https://smile.amazon.com/dp/0201119544)) - Older. Concludes with an introduction to abstract algebra with applications including cryptography.

#### Discrete math with a different focus

* Scheinerman. *Mathematics: A Discrete Introduction* ([3e](https://smile.amazon.com/dp/0840049420), [2e](https://smile.amazon.com/dp/0534398987)) - Covers a similar range of topics, but is aimed more at math majors.
* Ross. *Topics in Finite and Discrete Mathematics* ([1e Dover](https://www.amazon.com/dp/052177571X)) - Unusual topics include finance, linear programming and statistical inference. No coverage of logic or proofs.

#### More advanced approaches to discrete math for computer science

* Aho and Ullman, 1994. *Foundations of Computer Science: C Edition* ([**FREE ONLINE**](http://infolab.stanford.edu/~ullman/focs.html), [1e](https://smile.amazon.com/dp/0716782847)) - Combines discrete math with programming.

* Graham, Knuth, Patashnik. *Concrete Mathematics: A Foundation for Computer Science* ([2e](https://smile.amazon.com/dp/0201558025)) - One of the most well-loved books in math and computer science.
