# Logic and Discrete Math

## Logic

* Gensler, *Introduction to Logic*

  This is a really nice first course in logic, which covers all the core material
that you'd want to see in a first course, gives a tour of major philosophical applications of logic,
and also has a nice overview of less mainstream types of logics.

## Discrete Math

* (FREE) [Harvard CS 20 notes](https://www.seas.harvard.edu/courses/cs20/MIT6_042Notes.pdf)

* Rosen, *Discrete Mathematics and its Applications* ([6e](https://smile.amazon.com/dp/0073229725), [5e](https://smile.amazon.com/dp/0072424346))

  A pretty standard introduction to discrete math. I like this one because of its computer science focus. Older editions can be bought cheaply.

* Graham, Knuth, Patashnik. *Concrete Mathematics: A Foundation for Computer Science*
* Trudeau, *Introduction to Graph Theory*
* Chartrand, *Introductory Graph Theory*

* Hartsfield and Ringel. *Pearls in Graph Theory: A Comprehensive Introduction* [Dover ed](https://smile.amazon.com/Pearls-Graph-Theory-Comprehensive-Introduction/dp/0486432327/)

  More in-depth than Chartrand's other intro book.
