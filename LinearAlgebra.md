# Linear Algebra

- Strang, *Introduction to Linear Algebra* (with OCW lectures)

  The latest incarnation of Gilbert Strang's linear algebra textbook. I haven't seen this one myself, but it goes with his highly-regarded online LA course.

- Strang, *Linear Algebra and its Applications*
- Klein, *Coding the Matrix* (with Brown/Coursera course; great course but not much use as a stand-alone text)
- Axler, *Linear Algebra Done Right* ([2e](https://smile.amazon.com/Linear-Algebra-Right-Undergraduate-Mathematics/dp/0387982582/), [3e](https://smile.amazon.com/Linear-Algebra-Right-Undergraduate-Mathematics/dp/3319110799/))

  An outstanding introduction to an *abstract* approach to linear algebra. This book is all about proofs, you won't find calculations here. It is intended as a second course in linear algebra, to follow a more computation-oriented course, and I agree that this is its best use. You *could* start LA here, but you'd end up having read a whole book and still not knowing how to solve a linear equation.

- Hoffman and Kunze, *Linear Algebra* ([2e intl ed](https://smile.amazon.com/Linear-Algebra-2nd-Hoffman-Kunze/dp/8120302702/))

  For many years this was the standard LA textbook, though it seems it's not as popular as it used to be.

- Shilov, *Linear Algebra*
- Halmos, *Finite-Dimensional Vector Spaces*

  This is another abstract approach to LA that emphasizes connections to analysis and intends to prepare the student for a course in functional analysis. Interesting problems and a colorful exposition. Not really a first LA book, though.

Jim Hefferon has a free (GFDL) linear algebra text [http://joshua.smcvt.edu/linearalgebra/] which is available as a PDF file or as Latex source. It has exercises with worked answers.

Many people also favor the Schaum's Outline for linear algebra as well as Schaum's *3,000 Solved Problems in Linear Algebra*.
