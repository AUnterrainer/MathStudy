# Linear Algebra

- Strang, *Introduction to Linear Algebra* (with OCW lectures)

  The latest incarnation of Gilbert Strang's linear algebra textbook. I haven't seen this one myself, but it goes with his highly-regarded online LA course. It is reportedly somewhat more elementary than his older *Linear Algebra and its Applications*.

- Strang, *Linear Algebra and its Applications*

  Strang's older book.

- Klein, *Coding the Matrix* (with Brown/Coursera course; great course but not much use as a stand-alone text)

- Lay. *Linear Algebra and Its Applications* ([3e upd](https://smile.amazon.com/Linear-Algebra-Applications-Updated-CD-ROM/dp/0321287134/), [4e](https://smile.amazon.com/Linear-Algebra-Its-Applications-4th/dp/0321385179/). [5e](https://smile.amazon.com/Linear-Algebra-Its-Applications-5th/dp/032198238X/))

- Friedberg, Insel, Spence. *Linear Algebra* ([4e](https://smile.amazon.com/Linear-Algebra-4th-Stephen-Friedberg/dp/0130084514/), [4e intl](https://smile.amazon.com/Linear-Algebra-Lawrence-Stephen-Friedberg/dp/9332549648/), [3e](https://smile.amazon.com/Linear-Algebra-3rd-Stephen-Friedberg/dp/0132338599/))

- Axler, *Linear Algebra Done Right* ([2e](https://smile.amazon.com/Linear-Algebra-Right-Undergraduate-Mathematics/dp/0387982582/), [3e](https://smile.amazon.com/Linear-Algebra-Right-Undergraduate-Mathematics/dp/3319110799/))

  An outstanding introduction to an *abstract* approach to linear algebra. This book is all about proofs, you won't find calculations here. It is intended as a second course in linear algebra, to follow a more computation-oriented course, and I agree that this is its best use. You *could* start LA here, but you'd end up having read a whole book and still not knowing how to solve a linear equation.

- Hoffman and Kunze, *Linear Algebra* ([2e intl ed](https://smile.amazon.com/Linear-Algebra-2nd-Hoffman-Kunze/dp/8120302702/))

  For many years this was the standard LA textbook, though it seems it's not as popular as it used to be.

- Shilov, *Linear Algebra*

The major books that I'm aware of on advanced linear algebra (beyond a first course):

- Halmos, *Finite-Dimensional Vector Spaces* ([Martino ed](https://smile.amazon.com/Finite-Dimensional-Vector-Spaces-Halmos/dp/1614272816/), [Benediction ed](https://smile.amazon.com/Finite-Dimensional-Vector-Spaces-Paul-Halmos/dp/178139573X/), [Springer hardcover (OOP)](https://smile.amazon.com/Finite-Dimensional-Vector-Spaces-P-R-Halmos/dp/B004HOYQX2/))

  This is another abstract approach to LA that emphasizes connections to analysis and intends to prepare the student for a course in functional analysis. Interesting problems and a colorful exposition. Martino Fine Books has a good reputation for their physical product, but I don't know anything about the physical quality of the Benediction Classics edition. (My own copy is the old Springer hardcover.)

- Horn and Johnson. *Matrix Analysis* ([2e](https://smile.amazon.com/Matrix-Analysis-Roger-Horn/dp/0521548233/), [1e](https://smile.amazon.com/Matrix-Analysis-Roger-Horn/dp/0521386322/))

- Horn and Johnson. *Topics in Matrix Analysis* ([1e](https://smile.amazon.com/Topics-Matrix-Analysis-Roger-Horn/dp/052130587X/))

- Lax, *Linear Algebra and Its Applications* ([2e](https://smile.amazon.com/Linear-Algebra-Its-Applications-Peter/dp/0471751561/))

  This is a grad-level abstract linear algebra text by *Peter Lax*, not the introductory book by *David Lay*! The "applications" here are the pure mathematician's idea of a "application", which means applying the theory to a problem in mathematics, not applying mathematics to the real world.

- Roman, *Advanced Linear Algebra* ([3e](https://smile.amazon.com/Advanced-Linear-Algebra-Graduate-Mathematics/dp/0387728287/))

  Another grad-level abstract linear algebra book. In spirit it is similar to Axler's *Linear Algebra Done Right*, but from a more advanced perspective. (There is an international edition of this, but I'm not sure where I found it.)

Others:
- Anton, *Elementary Linear Algebra*
- Meyer, *Matrix Analysis and Applied Linear Algebra Book and Solutions Manual*
- Gentle, *Matrix Algebra: Theory, Computations, and Applications in Statistics*
- Bernstein, *Matrix Mathematics: Theory, Facts, and Formulas*
- Macdonald. *Linear and Geometric Algebra*

Jim Hefferon has a free (GFDL) linear algebra text [http://joshua.smcvt.edu/linearalgebra/] which is available as a PDF file or as Latex source. It has exercises with worked answers.

Many people also favor the Schaum's Outline for linear algebra as well as Schaum's *3,000 Solved Problems in Linear Algebra*.
