Jim Hefferon has a free (GFDL) linear algebra text [http://joshua.smcvt.edu/linearalgebra/] which is available as a PDF file or as Latex source. It has exercises with worked answers.

Many people also favor the Schaum's Outline for linear algebra as well as Schaum's *3,000 Solved Problems in Linear Algebra*.
