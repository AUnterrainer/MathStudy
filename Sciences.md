## Physics

### Introductions

- [OpenStax. *College Physics*](https://openstax.org/details/college-physics) (two-semester introductory algebra-based physics course)
- [OpenStax. *University Physics*](https://openstax.org/details/university-physics) (it's not ready yet, but this will presumably be a calculus-based physics course, though I can't find anywhere that this is specified)
- Wolfson and Pasachoff. *Physics for Scientists and Engineers, 3e*
  (the text used with [Ramamurti Shankar's online courses at Yale](http://oyc.yale.edu/physics))
- Shankar. *Fundamentals of Physics: Mechanics, Relativity, and Thermodynamics* (based on Shankar's first online course, [Fundamentals of Physics I](http://oyc.yale.edu/physics/phys-200))
- Shankar. *Fundamentals of Physics II: Electromagnetism, Optics, and Quantum Mechanics* (based on Shankar's first online course, [Fundamentals of Physics II](http://oyc.yale.edu/physics/phys-201))
- Bueche and Hecht. *Schaum's Outline of College Physics*

### Misc

- Landau and Lifshitz. *Course of Theoretical Physics* series

  A sprawling series of texts that span much of physics. The first three volumes are:

  - Mechanics
  - The Classical Theory of Fields
  - Quantum Mechanics
  
  At least some can be found (in the old Second Edition) at [The Internet Archive](https://archive.org/search.php?query=creator%3A%22L.D.+Landau+%26+E.M.+Lifshitz%22).
