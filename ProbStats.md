## Probability

#### General introductions

- Pitman, *Probability*

  Considered by many to be the best introduction to probability.

- Feller, *An Introduction to Probability Theory and its Applications* (volumes 1 & 2) (u)

#### Sheldon Ross
- Ross, *A First Course in Probability* (o)
- Ross, *A Second Course in Probability* (not very popular)
- Ross, *Introduction to Probability Models* (o)
- Ross, *Stochastic Processes* (u/i)

#### Karlin and Taylor
- Karlin and Taylor, *A First Course in Stochastic Processes* (u)
- Karlin and Taylor, *A Second Course in Stochastic Processes* (u)
- Karlin and Taylor, *An Introduction to Stochastic Modeling* (3e preferred)

#### Applied
- Mitzenmacher & Upfal, *Probability and Computing: Randomized Algorithms and Probabilistic Analysis*
- Ross, *Applied Probability Models with Optimization Applications* (c)

#### With measure theory

- Rosenthal, *A First Look at Rigorous Probability Theory* (c)

  This is, in particular, an introduction to measure theory. If you've already covered that adequately in real analysis then you might not need this book.

- Shiryaev, *Probability*
- Schilling, *Measures, Integrals and Martingales*
- Williams, *Probability with Martingales*
- Chung, *A Course in Probability Theory*
- Robert, *The Bayesian Choice: From Decision-Theoretic Foundations to Computational Implementation*
- Durrett, *Probability: Theory and Examples*
- Billingsley, *Probability and measure* (3e preferred)
- Kallenberg, *Foundations of Modern Probability*

## Statistics

- Freedman, Pisani & Purves, *Statistics* (u/o)

  Conceptual introduction to statistics with minimal math. Widely viewed as the best introduction to how to think about statistics.

- Diez, Barr, Çetinkaya-Rundel - *OpenIntro Statistics*

  Get it free online here: https://www.openintro.org/stat/textbook.php?stat_book=os

  There are also a couple of other editions that de-emphasize math in order to teach students who have less background.

- Cassela and Berger, *Statistical Inference* (i)

  The standard introduction to mathematical/theoretical statistics.

- Schervish, *Theory of Statistics*

  More advanced and complete book on theoretical statistics.

- Bickel & Doksum, *Mathematical Statistics: Basic Ideas and Selected Topics* (volumes I and II)

  Standard grad-level text on mathematical statistics.

- DeGroot & Schervish, *Probability and Statistics* (u)

  Another mathematical statistics textbook.

- Gelman et al, *Bayesian Data Analysis*

  Good first book on Bayesian analysis.

- Gelman & Hill, *Data Analysis Using Regression and Multilevel/Hierarchical Models*

  Good first book on multilevel/hierarchical models

- Fleiss, *The Design and Analysis of Clinical Experiments* (x)

  Standard book on clinical study design.

- Mandel, *The Statistical Analysis of Experimental Data* (c)

## Machine Learning

* MacKay, *Information Theory, Inference, and Learning Algorithms*
  
  Published 2003.
  http://www.inference.phy.cam.ac.uk/itila/p0.html

### The other big books

* Murphy, *Machine Learning: a Probabilistic Perspective*

  Published 2012.
  https://www.cs.ubc.ca/~murphyk/MLbook/

* Bishop, *Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning*

  Published 2006. AKA PRML. Bayesian viewpoint.
  http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/cmbishop/PRML/index.htm

* Bishop, *Neural Networks for Pattern Recognition*

  Published 1996. Old but still relevant.

* Abu-Mostafa, Magdon-Ismail, Lin, *Learning From Data*

  Published 2012. Goes with an online course from Caltech: https://work.caltech.edu/telecourse.html

* Mohri, Rostamizadeh, Talwalkar, *Foundations of Machine Learning*

  Published 2012.

* Koller, Friedman, *Probabilistic Graphical Models: Principles and Techniques*

  Published 2009. This is the reigning book on PGMs, but it demands more mathematical background (e.g. abstract algebra) than a lot of the other books listed here.

### Natural language processing

* Jurafsky and Martin, *Speech and Language Processing*

  The 2nd edition was published in 2008. A third edition is in progress, and the draft can be seen here: https://web.stanford.edu/~jurafsky/slp3/

* Manning and Schütze, *Foundations of Statistical Natural Language Processing*

  1999. Older, but still the other big book in this field.
