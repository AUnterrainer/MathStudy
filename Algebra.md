## Algebra (aka Abstract Algebra, Modern Algebra)

### First books

- Pinter, *A Course in Abstract Algebra* ([2e Dover](https://smile.amazon.com/dp/0486474178/))

  Pinter gives you a smooth start in algebra from the very beginning. Each chapter gives a short exposition (typically 4-8 pages) followed by lots of problems. Often the problems fill more pages than the text. In each chapter, problems begin with simple applications of definitions to concrete examples, progress to relatively simple proofs that follow from the definitions and theorems in the text to more difficult problems and, in an extended series of exercises, a proof of Sylow's Theorem.

- Herstein, *Abstract Algebra* ([3e hardcover OOP](https://smile.amazon.com/dp/0133745627/), [3e paperback](https://smile.amazon.com/dp/0471368792/)) or *Topics in Algebra* ([2e paperback](https://smile.amazon.com/dp/0471010901/), [2e intl](http://www.abebooks.com/products/isbn/9788126510184?cm_sp=bdp-_-9788126510184-_-isbn10))

  Herstein has lots of great problems. *Topics* is considered somewhat more challenging than *AA*.

- Gallian, *Contemporary Abstract Algebra* ([8e paperback](https://smile.amazon.com/dp/8131520749/), [7e](https://smile.amazon.com/dp/0547165099/), [6e](https://smile.amazon.com/dp/0618514716/))

- Shoup. *A Computational Introduction to Number Theory and Algebra* ([**FREE ONLINE**](http://shoup.net/ntb/); [2e at Amazon](https://smile.amazon.com/dp/0521516447))

- Connell, *Elements of Abstract and Linear Algebra* ([**FREE ONLINE**](http://www.math.miami.edu/~ec/book/))
