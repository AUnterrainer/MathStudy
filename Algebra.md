- Strang, *Introduction to Linear Algebra* (with OCW lectures)
- Strang, *Linear Algebra and its Applications*
- Klein, *Coding the Matrix* (with Brown/Coursera course; great course but not much use as a stand-alone text)
- Axler, *Linear Algebra Done Right* (2e or 3e)
- Hoffman and Kunze, *Linear Algebra*
- Shilov, *Linear Algebra*
- Halmos, *Finite-Dimensional Vector Spaces*

Others:
- Anton, *Elementary Linear Algebra*
- Meyer, *Matrix Analysis and Applied Linear Algebra Book and Solutions Manual*

- Bernstein, *Matrix Mathematics: Theory, Facts, and Formulas*

Jim Hefferon has a free (GFDL) linear algebra text [http://joshua.smcvt.edu/linearalgebra/] which is available as a PDF file or as Latex source. It has exercises with worked answers.

Many people also favor the Schaum's Outline for linear algebra as well as Schaum's *3,000 Solved Problems in Linear Algebra*.
