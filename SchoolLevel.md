# Grade school math

## High school math

### Harold Jacobs

- *Elementary Algebra*
- *Geometry: Seeing, Doing, Understanding*
- *Mathematics, a Human Endeavor*

### Old books in the public domain

These are apparently still really popular in India.

- Hall and Knight, *Elementary Algebra*
- Hall and Knight, *Higher Algebra*
- Loney, *Plane Trigonometry*

I don't know if anyone still uses these or not, but some people like them.

- Charles Smith, *A Treatise on Algebra*
- Wells, *A First Course in Algebra*
- Wells, *Second Course in Algebra*
- Wells, *University Algebra*

## The Russian texts

### Gelfand

Israel M. Gelfand (Гельфанд) wrote a series of books to teach fundamental mathematics to grade school students as part of a correspondence program. The resulting series of books covers from algebra through precalculus:

- *Functions and Graphs*
- *The Method of Coordinates*
- *Algebra*
- *Trigonometry*
- *Sequences, Combinations, Limits*

Rutgers still runs the Extended Gelfand Correspondence Program in Mathematics (http://www.egcpm.com/egcpm.html), which allows you to have your exercises graded. You could of course do them yourself, but no answers are provided.

Gelfand's books seem like a pretty interesting way to introduce high-school material to motivated students. They aren't as dry as most American textbooks, although they lack the color and gloss of the latter. However, I'm not sure if they really go into enough depth in some areas.

### Kiselev

Andrei P. Kiselev (Киселёв, also written Kiselyov) wrote a book called Geometry, which was the standard text in Russia for many decades (and was revised many times during that period). It is available in English in two volumes, *Planimetry* and *Stereometry*, which were adapted for the USA by Alexander Givental.

*Volume I: Planimetry* covers lines, circles, similarity, regular polygons and areas. *Volume II: Stereometry* covers figures in three dimensions: lines and planes, polyhedra and round solids; then it wraps up with an introduction to vectors and then an overview of the history of geometry and a brief introduction to non-Euclidean geometry. *Volume II* in particular goes well beyond what high school students are expected to learn from a geometry course, and it gets very dense.

## Barbeau

A quote from the introduction of Barbeau's *Polynomials*:

> This book is not a textbook. Nor is its topic being particularly recommended for inclusion, indiscriminately, into the school curriculum. However, it should convey some of the breadth and depth found close to the traditional school and college curricula, and encourage the reader not only to follow up on some of the historical and technical references, but to pull out pen and paper to tackle some problems of special interest. Some of the mathematics will be difficult, but I believe that it will all be accessible.
> 
> The intended audience consists of students at both high school and college who wish to go beyond the usual curriculum, as well as teachers who wish to broaden their mathematical experience and discover possible material for use with their regular or enriched students. In particular, I am concerned about two groups of students.  There are those who romp through the school curriculum in mathematics while they have yet to complete other subjects. A standard response to this situation is to accelerate them, either into calculus or into college prematurely.
> 
> While this is undoubtedly appropriate for some, my experience is that very often such acceleration is counterproductive and leads to an unsettled academic experience.  Then there are those who get caught up in contest activity. It is now possible to spend much of the spring semester preparing for and writing contests, and this may have some value. However, there are some for whom contests are not congenial and others who emphasize the short-term goal of solving problems and winning contests at the expense of proper mathematical growth.
> 
> What seems to be needed is a mathematical enrichment which starts with school mathematics, broadens it and yet is sufficiently down-to-earth that the student can explore it in an elementary way with pencil and paper or calculator.

This book covers algebra, but it covers it much more deeply than typical high school courses. It would be appropriate, as Barbeau suggests, as enrichment reading for a high school student who is too advanced for the usual curriculum but has not been accelerated through it. It would help to remedy one of the failings of the typical high school curriculum, which is that algebra is typically not taught very thoroughly, then when it comes time to learn calculus, students' algebra skills are weak and their calculus skills suffer for it.

# Geometry (more advanced books)

- Hartshorne *Geometry: Euclid and Beyond*
- Moise, *Elementary Geometry From An Advanced Viewpoint*
- Greenberg, *Euclidean And Non-Euclidean Geometries*
- Eves, *A Survey of Geometry*

# Abstract Algebra

In principal, there is nothing stopping high school students from being able to read abstract algebra immediately after completing an elementary introduction to algebra. A book like Pinter's *A Book of Abstract Algebra* should be attainable for a motivated student (at least the part I've read so far).
