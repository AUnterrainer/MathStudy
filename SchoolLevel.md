# Grade school math

## The Russian texts

### Gelfand

Israel M. Gelfand (Гельфанд) wrote a series of books to teach fundamental mathematics to grade school students as part of a correspondence program. The resulting series of books covers from algebra through precalculus:

- *Functions and Graphs*
- *The Method of Coordinates*
- *Algebra*
- *Trigonometry*
- *Sequences, Combinations, Limits*

Rutgers still runs the Extended Gelfand Correspondence Program in Mathematics (http://www.egcpm.com/egcpm.html), which allows you to have your exercises graded. You could of course do them yourself, but no answers are provided.

Gelfand's books seem like a pretty interesting way to introduce high-school material to motivated students. They aren't as dry as most American textbooks, although they lack the color and gloss of the latter. However, I'm not sure if they really go into enough depth in some areas.

### Kiselev

Andrei P. Kiselev (Киселёв, also written Kiselyov) wrote a book called Geometry, which was the standard text in Russia for many decades (and was revised many times during that period). It is available in English in two volumes, *Planimetry* and *Stereometry*, which were adapted for the USA by Alexander Givental.

*Volume I: Planimetry* covers lines, circles, similarity, regular polygons and areas. *Volume II: Stereometry* covers figures in three dimensions: lines and planes, polyhedra and round solids; then it wraps up with an introduction to vectors and then an overview of the history of geometry and a brief introduction to non-Euclidean geometry. *Volume II* in particular goes well beyond what high school students are expected to learn from a geometry course, and it gets very dense.
