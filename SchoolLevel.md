## Gelfand

Israel M. Gelfand (Гельфанд) wrote a series of books to teach fundamental mathematics to grade school students as part of a correspondence program. The resulting series of books covers from algebra through precalculus: *Algebra*, *Functions and Graphs*, *The Method of Coordinates* and *Trigonometry*. He also, with some co-authors, wrote a book called *Sequences, Combinations, Limits* that might be seen as a sort of pre-calculus book that, among other things, introduces the principal of mathematical induction.

Rutgers still runs the Extended Gelfand Correspondence Program in Mathematics (http://www.egcpm.com/egcpm.html), which allows you to have your exercises graded. You could of course do them yourself, but no answers are provided.

## Kiselyev

Andrei P. Kiselyov (Киселёв) wrote a book called Geometry, which was the standard text in Russia for many decades (and was revised many times during that period). It is available in English in two volumes, *Planimetry* and *Stereometry*, which were adapted for the USA by Alexander Givental.

Volume I (*Planimetry*) covers lines, circles, similarity, regular polygons and areas. Volume II (*Stereometry*) covers figures in three dimensions: lines and planes, polyhedra and round solids; then it wraps up with an introduction to vectors and then an overview of the history of geometry and a brief introduction to non-Euclidean geometry. Volume II in particular goes well beyond what high school students are expected to learn from a geometry course, and it gets very dense.
